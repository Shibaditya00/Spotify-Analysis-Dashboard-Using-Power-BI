## 📌 Project Overview

With millions of songs and users, Spotify generates massive data daily. This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing Spotify listening activity through:

* Monthly and yearly trends
* Weekend vs weekday patterns
* Listening behavior by artist, album, and track
* Drill-through details for in-depth exploration

---

## 💼 Business Requirements

The analysis is divided into five core segments:

### 1. 🎵 Albums Analysis

* Total albums played over time: Track how album listening trends change over months and years.
* Number of Albums Listened by Year: Identify annual listening habits and volumes.
* Top 5 albums: Identify the most played albums based on listening frequency.
* Latest Year vs Previous Year Analysis: Compare album consumption between the latest and the previous years, including:
	* LY (Latest Year) vs PY (Previous Year) Trends
	* YoY (Year-over-Year) Growth Analysis


### 2. 👤 Artists Analysis

* Total artists played over time: Track how artist listening trends change across months and years.
* Number of Artists Listened by Year: Identify annual listening habits and volumes.
* Top 5 artists: Identify the most played artists based on listening frequency.
* Latest Year vs Previous Year Analysis: Compare artist engagement between the latest and the previous years, including:
	* LY (Latest Year) vs PY (Previous Year) Trends
	* YoY (Year-over-Year) Growth Analysis

### 3. 🎶 Tracks Analysis

* Total artists played over time: Monitor how track listening trends change across months and years.
* Number of Tracks Listened by Year: Identify annual listening habits and track diversity.
* Top 5 tracks: Identify the most played tracks based on listening frequency.
* Latest Year vs Previous Year Analysis: Compare track engagement between the latest and the previous years, including:
	* LY (Latest Year) vs PY (Previous Year) Trends
	* YoY (Year-over-Year) Growth Analysis

### 4. ⏱️ Listening Pattern

* Listening Hours Analysis: Identify peak listening times using a Heat Map that visualises patterns across hours and days with colour frequency.
* Average Listening Time (min) vs Track Frequency: Use a Scatter Plot with Quadrant Analysis to categorize tracks based on:
	* High Frequency and High Listening Time: Most engaged tracks
	* Low Frequency and High Listening Time: Niche but impactful tracks
	* High Frequency and Low Listening Time: Short and frequently played tracks
	* Low Frequency and Low Listening Time: Less popular tracks


### 5. 🗂️ Details Grid View

In this report, we aim to analyze Spotify data by creating an interactive and dynamic Grid View. The grid will display key details such as Album Name, Artist Name, Track Name and other relevant attributes.
Key Requirements:
1. Grid view with essential fields
	* The grid should present critical data points for an intuitive and structured view
2. Drill through functionality
	* Users should be able to drill through from the main reports to explore underlying data for detailed insights
	* The drilled-through data should be exportable to a CSV file based on user requirements
3. Drill down, Drill up and Hierarchy
	* The grid should support hierarchical navigation, allowing users to drill down and up for in-depth data exploration
